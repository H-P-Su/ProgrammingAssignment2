## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

# Based on the template, makeVector, this function should contain:
# set the value of the matrix
# get the value of the matrix
# set the value of the inverse matrix
# get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


# this function should see if the inverse has been set.
# if the inverse has been set, it should get the inverse matrix
# if the inverse has not been set, it should set the inverse matrix with the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
